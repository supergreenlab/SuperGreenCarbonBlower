# SuperGreenCarbonBlower

This repository is a work in progress, the point is to create a blower + filter system, wanted features are:
- silence, blower can do a lot of noise when directly blowing in the room, better to have it inside the box, but still has to blow the air outside.
- can adapt to a wide variety of sizes.
- also allows to deport the filter + blower system outside

The part of the box in front of the outtake is closed on purpose, cut a hole where it'll fit most with your design.
